 ### Hi 👋, I'm Sumaiyya Fareed

I’m a data analyst and I hold a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan. With a mix of machine learning, big data, and a dash of humor, I bring a fresh perspective to every project. From the luxury retail industry to automotive innovation, I’ve been busy decoding data mysteries and turning them into actionable insights. Fluent in SQL, Python, and sarcasm, I’m on a mission to make data not just informative, but fun.

### About me:
- I enjoy transforming raw data into impactful business decisions through data analytics and visualizations.
- I'm passionate about using **customer analytics** to uncover trends and behaviors that drive strategic decision-making and improve customer experiences.
- I’m a certified **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate** [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/dd11a2fe-31fe-4d7a-9397-0ed3aaef12f4), with a strong focus on cloud-based data solutions and infrastructure optimization.
- Outside of work, I love getting lost in the works of Khaled Hosseini and Elif Shafak , whose storytelling and cultural insights captivate me.
